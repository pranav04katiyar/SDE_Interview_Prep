### 1. What is Dependency Injection
- Dependency Injection is a design pattern which says "Whenever a class is dependent on another class, instead of creating an object of the dependency within the class, we should pass it as a parameter to a constructor or through a setter method, keeping the class loosely-coupled, easy to test and maintain."
  - It is used to remove the hard-coded dependencies and make the application loosely-coupled and easy to maintain.
  - It also facilitates the reusability of the dependencies and makes the application easy to test and modify.
- There are 2 types of Dependency Injection:
  - Constructor Injection: The dependencies are provided through the class constructor.
  - Setter Injection: The dependencies are provided through setter methods.
- The main idea in Dependency Injection is that you donâ€™t have to create your objects but you just have to describe how they should be created.
  - Example: 
    ```java
    public class Car {
        private Engine engine;
        public Car(Engine engine) {
            this.engine = engine;
        }
    }
    ```
    ```java
    public class Engine {
        public void start() {
            System.out.println("Engine started");
        }
    }
    ```
    ```java
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Engine engine = new Engine();
            Car car = new Car(engine);
        }
    }
    ```
    - In the above example, the `Car` class is dependent on the `Engine` class. 
    - Instead of creating an object of the `Engine` class within the `Car` class, we are passing it as a parameter to the constructor of the `Car` class.
